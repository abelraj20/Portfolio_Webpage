    <p class="paragraph1">
    My name is Abel Rajesh. I was born on the 21st of March 2004 in Kerala, India. At the age of 2, I 
    <br>moved to Ireland after my mother secured a job opportunity here. Growing up in Ireland has been 
    <br>an enriching experience, allowing me to blend the cultural heritage of my birthplace with the 
    dynamic <br>environment of my new home.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph2">
    <br>I attended primary school at St. Marks School and continued my education at Rockbrook Park School<br> 
    for secondary school. Currently, I am in my third year at <strong>Dublin City University</strong>, 
    where I am studying <br><strong>Physics with Data Analytics</strong>. This academic path has fueled my 
    passion for coding and harnessing <br>data to draw meaningful insights.
